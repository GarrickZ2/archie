  Manage feature execution: generate tasks, track progress, advance status.

  ## Guard Check
  - Status MUST be: `DESIGNED`, `SPEC_READY`, `IMPLEMENTING`, `FINISHED`
  - If status < DESIGNED → STOP, run `design` or `spec` first

  ## Reads
  - features/<key>.md, workflow/<key>/*, spec/<key>.spec.md, tasks.md

  ## Writes
  - tasks.md
  - features/<key>.md (status + changelog only)

  ## Operations

  ### Generate Plan
  Create task list from design artifacts.
  Present plan → get approval → write tasks.md

  ### Update Progress
  Mark tasks as DOING/DONE, update feature status.
  Valid transitions: DESIGNED/SPEC_READY → IMPLEMENTING → FINISHED

  ### Update Timeline
  Adjust estimates based on progress.

  ### Manage Tasks
  Add/update/complete individual tasks.

  ## Task Structure
  - Status: [ ] TODO / [>] DOING / [x] DONE
  - Owner, ETA, Dependencies
  - Description + Definition of Done
  - Append-only log

  ## Core Rules
  - Forward-only status transitions
  - No design changes (use `revise` instead)
  - User approval required for all writes
  - Generate tasks if missing for DESIGNED/SPEC_READY feature
