  Fix formatting/structure without semantic changes.

  ## Guard Check
  - Any status allowed
  - Required: target file exists

  ## Reads
  - Target file
  - Corresponding schema (.archie/docs/schema/<file>.md)

  ## Writes
  - Target file (formatting only)
  - blocker.md (if semantic issues found)

  ## Workflow
  1. Read file, detect formatting issues against schema
  2. Present issues + proposed fixes (before/after)
  3. Get approval → apply formatting fixes
  4. If semantic issues found → create blocker, suggest correct command

  ## Allowed Fixes
  - Markdown syntax errors
  - Indentation, heading levels
  - Section ordering per schema
  - Field formats (dates, status enums)
  - Extra whitespace

  ## Forbidden
  - Changing business requirements
  - Modifying design decisions
  - Rewriting content meaning
  - Changing workflow logic

  ## Example
  Allowed: `Business Goal` → `## Business Goal`
  Forbidden: Status DESIGNED but no workflow → create blocker, do NOT change status
