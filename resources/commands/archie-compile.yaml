  Reformat tech design into a clear, human-readable document. Prioritize readability over completeness.

  ## Guard Check
  - At least one feature with status: `DESIGNED`, `SPEC_READY`, `IMPLEMENTING`, or `FINISHED`
  - Required design artifacts exist (features/, workflow/, etc.)
  - If no designed features → STOP, instruct complete design first

  ## Reads
  - All relevant design artifacts: features/, workflow/, api/, storage.md, metrics.md, dependency.md
  - background.md, glossary.md for context

  ## Writes
  - assets/exports/tech-design-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md (human-readable doc)

  ## Workflow

  ### 1. Read Design Artifacts
  Read available design documents
  Understand context from background.md and glossary.md

  ### 2. Understand and Synthesize
  - Identify key information across documents
  - Understand relationships between components
  - Note any gaps or blockers

  ### 3. Reformat for Human Readers
  **Critical: Do NOT just copy-paste content**

  Reformat into professional technical design with clear explanations:
  - Use standard technical document structure
  - Explain technical decisions with context
  - Define terms clearly (reference glossary)
  - Provide brief explanations where needed
  - Keep professional tone, avoid jargon dumping
  - Ensure diagrams have clear labels and captions

  Standard technical design structure:

  ```
  # Technical Design Document

  ## Overview
  **Purpose**: [What problem does this solve?]
  **Scope**: [What's included/excluded]
  **Status**: [Current design status]

  ## Requirements
  [Key functional and non-functional requirements]
  [Acceptance criteria]

  ## Architecture
  [System components and their responsibilities]
  [Component diagram or description]
  [Integration points]

  ## Workflow
  [Process flows with clear step descriptions]
  [Include flowchart and sequence diagrams]
  [Happy path and error scenarios]

  ## API Design
  [Service interfaces]
  [Key endpoints/methods with descriptions]
  [Request/response formats]

  ## Data Model
  [Storage schema]
  [Key entities and relationships]
  [Data access patterns]

  ## Metrics & Monitoring
  [Success metrics]
  [SLIs/SLOs]
  [Monitoring strategy]

  ## Dependencies
  [External systems and services]
  [Integration requirements]

  ## Open Questions (Optional)
  [Unresolved technical decisions]
  [Known gaps or blockers]
  ```

  ### 4. User Approval
  Present document outline and approach

  If gaps/blockers found, ask: "Include 'Open Questions' section?"

  Confirm document is readable and clear before writing

  ### 5. Write After Approval
  Write to assets/exports/tech-design-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md

  ## Core Rules: Professional and Readable

  **DO**:
  - Use standard technical design document structure
  - Provide context and explanations for technical decisions
  - Define terms clearly (reference glossary consistently)
  - Use tables, diagrams, and structured formats appropriately
  - Write concisely but completely
  - Ensure technical accuracy while maintaining clarity

  **DO NOT**:
  - Copy-paste raw content without reformatting
  - Use unexplained acronyms or internal jargon
  - Include code snippets without explanation
  - Assume reader has full project context
  - Present information without logical flow

  ## Output Focus
  Professional technical design document that engineers, architects, and technical stakeholders can review and understand without needing to read the entire codebase.
