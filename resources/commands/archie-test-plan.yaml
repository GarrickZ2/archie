  Generate test case checklists from workflow paths and spec requirements.

  ## Guard Check
  - Status MUST be: `DESIGNED`, `SPEC_READY`, `IMPLEMENTING`, `FINISHED`
  - If status < DESIGNED → STOP

  ## Reads
  - features/<key>.md, workflow/<key>/*, spec/<key>.spec.md

  ## Writes
  - testplan/<key>.md
  - features/<key>.md (Design Artifacts testplan link + changelog)

  ## Operations

  ### Generate
  Create test plan from design artifacts.
  1. Parse workflow paths, API endpoints, spec requirements
  2. Generate test cases (Unit/Integration/E2E)
  3. Present to user → get approval → write

  ### Update
  Refresh test cases based on design changes.
  Compare artifacts vs existing plan → propose additions → get approval

  ## Test Plan Structure
  - Test ID: `<key>-{U|I|E}-<###>`
  - Priority: P0 (critical), P1 (important), P2 (nice-to-have)
  - Status: [ ] TODO, [x] DONE
  - Reference: link to workflow/spec section

  ## Core Rules
  - All main workflow paths have test cases
  - Critical error paths documented
  - Every test links to source
  - Keep descriptions brief and actionable
