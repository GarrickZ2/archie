  Generate execution-ready coding specifications from design artifacts.

  ### Purpose
  Generate a Coding Spec for implementation (agent-friendly, execution-focused).

  ### Allowed Status
  - `DESIGNED`

  ### Reads
  - `features/<feature-key>.md`
  - `api/api.md` + relevant `api/*.thrift`
  - `workflow/<feature-key>/*`
  - `storage.md`
  - `metrics.md`
  - `tasks.md`
  - `blocker.md`, `faq.md`

  ### Writes
  - `spec/<feature-key>.spec.md`
  - `features/<feature-key>.md` (Spec section + status + changelog)

  ### Required Outputs
  - Spec contains: interfaces, data model, workflow, edge cases, observability, rollout, test plan.
  - `features/<feature-key>.md`:
      - `Spec.Location` points to the spec file
      - `Spec.Readiness` set to `READY`
      - Status set to `SPEC_READY`

  ### Correction Behavior
  If any design artifact is missing (API/storage/workflow/metrics/tasks):
  - Refuse to mark READY; create blockers listing missing artifacts; set status to `UNDER_DESIGN` or `BLOCKED`.

  ### Prompt Skeleton (Orchestrator)
  - Goal: consolidate design outputs into an executable spec.
  - Steps:
      1. Validate design completeness.
      2. Derive spec sections deterministically from artifacts.
      3. Record assumptions and explicit non-goals.
      4. Write spec file; update feature spec link/readiness/status.
