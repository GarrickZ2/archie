  Clarify business requirements, scope, and logic. Prepare feature for design phase.

  ## Guard Check
  - Status MUST be: `NOT_REVIEWED`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `BLOCKED`
  - Required: features/<key>.md exists
  - If missing → instruct `revise --create`

  ## Reads
  - background.md, glossary.md, features/<key>.md

  ## Writes
  - features/<key>.md (Requirements, Scope, Feature Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria)
  - blocker.md (if requirements unclear)

  ## Workflow

  ### 1. Understand Context
  Read background.md, glossary.md, features/<key>.md
  Use glossary terms consistently

  ### 2. Explore Requirements
  Ask: business goal, users, use cases, success criteria

  ### 3. Clarify Scope
  Ask: in/out of scope, must-haves, constraints, feature dependencies

  ### 4. Define Business Logic
  Ask: main flow, edge cases, business rules, failure scenarios

  ### 5. User Approval
  Present summary → ask confirmation

  ### 6. Write After Approval
  - Update features/<key>.md
  - Status → READY_FOR_DESIGN
  - Changelog entry

  ## Output Focus
  Business-readable only. NO technical details (API, storage, services).

  ## Correction Behavior
  - Feature missing → `revise --create`
  - Requirements unclear → create blocker, status BLOCKED
