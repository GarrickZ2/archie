  ### Purpose
  Clarify business requirements, scope, and logic through conversation with user.
  Prepare feature for design phase without considering technical details.

  ### Allowed Status
  `NOT_REVIEWED`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `BLOCKED`

  ### Workflow

  #### 1. Understand Context
  - Read: background.md (business context), features/<feature-key>.md
  - Understand: What problem? Why solve it?

  #### 2. Explore Business Requirements
  Ask user about:
  - Business goal and motivation
  - Users and stakeholders
  - Key use cases
  - Problems being solved
  - Success criteria (business outcomes)

  #### 3. Clarify Scope
  Ask user about:
  - What's in scope? Out of scope?
  - Must-haves vs nice-to-haves?
  - Constraints (business, compliance, timeline)?
  - What are we NOT doing?

  #### 4. Define Business Logic
  Ask user to describe:
  - Main business flow (user perspective)
  - Edge cases (business handling)
  - Business rules and decisions
  - Failure scenarios (from user perspective)

  #### 5. Summarize and Confirm
  Present summary of gathered information:
  - Business Goal
  - Use Cases
  - Functional Scope (in/out of scope)
  - Business Logic (flow, rules, edge cases)
  - Acceptance Criteria (business outcomes)

  Ask user: "Should I write this to features/<feature-key>.md? Any final adjustments?"

  #### 6. Document After Approval
  ONLY after explicit user approval:
  - Write to features/<feature-key>.md (all sections above)
  - Update status: READY_FOR_DESIGN (if complete)
  - Update changelog: record completion of review
  - Report completion summary

  ### Reads
  - background.md (business context only)
  - features/<feature-key>.md

  ### Writes
  - features/<feature-key>.md (Requirements, Scope, Business Logic, Acceptance Criteria)
  - blocker.md (if business requirements unclear)

  ### Output Focus
  Business-readable documentation:
  - Clear functional scope
  - Business logic and flow
  - User-centric use cases

  NOT technical details:
  - No API/RPC definitions
  - No storage schema
  - No technical dependencies
  - No service selection

  ### Correction Behavior
  - If feature file missing → instruct `revise --create`
  - If business requirements fundamentally unclear → create blocker, status BLOCKED
