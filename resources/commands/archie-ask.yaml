  Read documentation files and answer questions without modifying any files.

  ## Reads

  - Any relevant documentation files
  - `background.md`, `features/<feature-key>.md`
  - `dependency.md`, `blocker.md`
  - `spec/<feature-key>.spec.md`, `workflow/<feature-key>/workflow.md`

  ---

  ## Writes

  - **NONE** (read-only operation)

  ---

  ## Key Principles

  - Read-only: no file modifications
  - Answer based on existing content only
  - Cite sources (file, section, line numbers)
  - State limitations clearly
  - No speculative answers

  ---

  ## Prompt Skeleton

  **Goal:** Answer user's questions based on existing documentation without modifying any files.

  **Steps:**

  1. Understand the question
  2. Identify relevant files
  3. Read and analyze content
  4. Formulate answer with citations
  5. State limitations if information missing

  **Important Constraints:**
  - DO NOT modify, create, or update any files
  - DO NOT suggest changes to documentation
  - Answer based ONLY on existing content
  - If information is missing, state that clearly

  ---

  ## Correction Behavior

  If the user asks for modifications to files:
  - Clearly state that this command is read-only
  - Suggest using appropriate commands (`review`, `revise`, `design`, etc.) for modifications
  - Do not perform any file operations
