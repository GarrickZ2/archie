content: |
  Bootstrap an Archie project workspace by normalizing content into Archie schemas.

  ## Guard Check
  - No status requirement (can run anytime)
  - If workspace already initialized → warn user, ask if re-init intended

  ## Inputs
  Minimum: Project name + feature list (or background text to derive features)
  Optional: Timeline, tech stack, design rules, stakeholders, existing docs

  ## Reads
  - background.md, glossary.md (if present)
  - Existing feature notes, PRD, design docs (if present)

  ## Writes
  - background.md, glossary.md
  - features/<key>.md (one per feature)

  ## Workflow

  ### 1. Gather Information
  Collect: project name, features, tech stack, design rules, stakeholders
  Collect: service names, upstream/downstream systems, key terms → for glossary.md

  ### 2. Plan
  - Files to create (background.md, glossary.md, features/*.md)
  - Files to normalize (existing docs → schema)
  - Feature set

  ### 3. User Approval
  Show plan → ask confirmation

  ### 4. Execute After Approval
  - Create background.md, glossary.md
  - Create features/<key>.md with Status: NOT_REVIEWED
  - Preserve legacy content in assets/refs/
  - Validate schema compliance

  ### 5. Report
  Summary + suggest `archie review <key>`

  ## Success Criteria
  - background.md, glossary.md exist
  - At least one feature file exists
  - No content loss (legacy preserved)
