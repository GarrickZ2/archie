  ### Purpose
  Refine business requirements at any stage through user dialogue.
  Primary operation: Modify (iterate on requirements with user).

  ### Operations

  #### Modify (Default) - Business Requirement Refinement

  Workflow:
  1. Understand Change Intent
     - Ask: What needs to change? Why?
     - Ask: What's unclear or incorrect?

  2. Business Context Discussion
     - Ask: Has business goal changed?
     - Ask: New use cases or constraints?
     - Discuss: Scope adjustments needed?

  3. Refine Requirements
     - Iteratively clarify with user:
       - Functional scope
       - Business logic
       - Acceptance criteria

  4. Present Proposed Changes
     - Show what will be updated in features/<feature-key>.md
     - Show proposed changelog entry
     - Ask user: "Should I apply these changes?"

  5. Document Changes After Approval
     - ONLY after explicit user approval:
       - Update features/<feature-key>.md
       - Update changelog (requirement changes, rationale)
       - Report completion summary

  #### Create
  Add new feature through business dialogue.

  Workflow:
  1. Collect Information
     - Ask: What's the business goal?
     - Ask: Key use cases?
     - Ask: Functional scope?

  2. Present New Feature
     - Show proposed feature file content
     - Ask user: "Should I create this feature?"

  3. Create Feature File After Approval
     - ONLY after explicit user approval:
       - Write features/<feature-key>.md
       - Status: NOT_REVIEWED
       - Report completion

  #### Merge / Split / Delete

  **All operations require explicit user approval before execution.**

  **Merge**: Combine features, reconcile requirements if >= DESIGNED
  1. Discuss business rationale with user
  2. Show how requirements will be combined
  3. Get approval before merging

  **Split**: Decompose feature, redistribute requirements if >= DESIGNED
  1. Discuss decomposition strategy with user
  2. Show how requirements will be redistributed
  3. Get approval before splitting

  **Delete**: Archive feature (extra confirmation if >= SPEC_READY)
  1. Discuss business impact with user
  2. Show what will be archived and where
  3. For features >= SPEC_READY: Ask for extra confirmation
  4. Get explicit approval before archiving

  ### Reads
  - background.md, features/<feature-key>.md, blocker.md

  ### Writes
  - features/<feature-key>.md (Requirements, Scope, Logic, Acceptance Criteria)
  - blocker.md
  - assets/archive/features/ (for delete)

  ### Core Rules
  1. **Business dialogue first** - Discuss with user before making changes
  2. **Traceability** - Document what changed in requirements and why
  3. **Status integrity** - Roll back status if requirements become incomplete
  4. **Iterative refinement** - Multiple revise cycles expected and encouraged
