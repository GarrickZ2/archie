  Refine business requirements at any stage through user dialogue.

  ## Guard Check
  - Any status allowed
  - Required: features/<key>.md exists (for modify/merge/split/delete)
  - For create: no existing feature with same key

  ## Reads
  - background.md, glossary.md, features/<key>.md, blocker.md

  ## Writes
  - features/<key>.md (Requirements, Scope, Feature Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria)
  - blocker.md, assets/archive/features/ (for delete)

  ## Operations

  ### Modify (Default)
  1. Ask: what needs to change? why?
  2. Discuss: scope, business logic, acceptance criteria
  3. Present proposed changes → get approval
  4. Write changes + changelog

  ### Create
  1. Ask: business goal, use cases, scope
  2. Present feature file → get approval
  3. Write features/<key>.md with Status: NOT_REVIEWED

  ### Merge
  Combine features. Get approval → merge files → archive original

  ### Split
  Decompose feature. Get approval → create new files → update original

  ### Delete
  Archive feature. Extra confirmation if >= SPEC_READY
  Archive to assets/archive/features/

  ## Core Rules
  - Business dialogue first
  - Traceability: document what changed and why
  - Roll back status if requirements become incomplete
